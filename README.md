# BloodNet

Accessing blood during emergencies is often chaotic and inefficient, relying on unverified social media posts and word-of-mouth. There is no centralized system to quickly connect eligible donors with nearby, verified requests. This leads to delays, missed opportunities, and privacy concernsâ€”highlighting the urgent need for a secure, location-based blood donation platform.

**Proposed Solution:**  
An application that connects verified donors to nearby urgent blood requests with **location-based filtering**, ensuring fast, secure, and reliable communication between donors and recipients.
